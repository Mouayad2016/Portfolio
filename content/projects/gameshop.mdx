## E-commerce website

This project is an e-commerce website selling video games.

### Frameworks

We've decided to use Python and Django for our backend structure.

For the frontend, the framework in use is React with Bootstrap.

And for the API, the application in use is Postman.

Usage/Examples
We're using serializers instead of regular django form.

### serializers.py
```py
python
Copy code
from .models import Product
from rest_framework import serializers

class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = '__all__'

```
### views.py

```py
from .serializers import ProductSerializer
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status

@api_view(['GET'])
def getProduct(request):
    try:
        product = Product.objects.all()
        serializer = ProductSerializer(product, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
    except Exception as e:
        return Response(str(e), status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
