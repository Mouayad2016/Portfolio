MAI is a mobile application designed to automate legal operations by using advanced AI technology combined with Swedish laws.
This application integrates with the Chatbase API and utilizes chatbots as assistants.
We are aiming to further develop this application by using Langchain library, to answer accurate questions across various law categories.
The application is currently incomplete and still under development. Additional features, such as text summarization, will be introduced.
The web application features a Firebase backend integration.
