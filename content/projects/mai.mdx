Mouayad AI is a mobile application designed to automate legal operations by using advanced AI technology combined with Swedish laws. 
This application integrates with the Chatbase API and utilizes chatbots as assistants. 
We are aiming to further develop this application by using Langchain as the provider and building on top of their platform, which is trained on Swedish laws, to answer questions across various categories.
The application is currently incomplete and still under development. 
Additional features, such as text summarization, will be introduced, and the entire development will rely on the Langchain AI library. 
The web application features a Firebase backend integration.
